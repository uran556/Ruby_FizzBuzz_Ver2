# I made a FizzBuzz program to practice Ruby!

I used the each statement to output 1 to 100 in order, and then set up the FizzBuzz program.

- number divisible by 3 is passed as an argument, "Fizz" is returned.
<br>
- number divisible by 5 is passed as an argument, "Buzz" is returned.
<br>
- number divisible by both 3 and 5 is passed as an argument, "FizzBuzz" is returned.
<br>
- All other values will be output as is.
